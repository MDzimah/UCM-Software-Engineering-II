# SEII Project

## General Description

The goal of this project is to build an information management application using a 3-layer architecture: Presentation, Business, and Integration.

## Constraints

- It is mandatory to implement the project using the architectural and design patterns explained in class, applied correctly.
- The language used to describe the application's design must be *UML 2.x*, and the modeling tool must be *Modelio 5.*
- The application must be a *desktop* application (not web-based).
- The implementation language must be *Java*, and the development environment must be *Eclipse.*
- Data persistence must be done in *JSON* format.
- The code must include *JUnit* tests.
- It is recommended to use a version control system for development. If used, it should be *Git and GitHub.*

## Starting the Project

- Choose a type of billing (or ticket-generating) management project.  
  Example: Bakery Management.
- Domain model with class diagram.
- Identified subsystems (all projects must include the Invoices subsystem).
- For the subsystems indicated in class, include their U.C.D. and specify each U.C. with an activity diagram (in Modelio 5.4).
- Throughout the course, additional diagrams related to the IS2 course will be required: class diagrams, sequence diagrams...

## Package Hierarchy

Subsystems must be subdivided and organized into *3 layers/packages: integration, business, and presentation.*
